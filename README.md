# Research Intern Placement Evaluation

This repository contains two carefully evaluated scenarios for research intern placement.

## Scenario 2: Reviews Sentiment Analysis

An online fashion retailer wants to develop a machine learning model that can classify customer reviews into different sentiment categories. The model will take as input a customer review and output a prediction of the review's sentiment, such as positive,
negative, or neutral. Develop a ML model for aforesaid classification with an example Dataset.

## Scenario 2: Hospital Readmissions

A hospital has a large dataset of patient records, including information on demographics, medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. The hospital wants to use this data to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of readmission for patients
after they are discharged from the hospital. Develop a ML solution for the aforesaid prediction with an example Dataset.
